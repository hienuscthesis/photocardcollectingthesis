             <p class="sidecap"> Girls' Generation's "The Boys" physical CD </p>

        </section>

          <p> The first K-pop album I physically held was <strong class="standout">Girls’ Generation</strong>’s  2011 album, <span class="soundcite" data-url="media/theboys.mp3" data-start="0" data-plays="1">“The Boys.”</span> My friend brought her copy to class just a week after its official release and showed it to me, a starry-eyed fifth grader who had just become acquainted with the South Korean music scene. K-pop became popular in Vietnam in the early 2010s not only for its catchy melodies and captivating choreographies but also transcended being just a music genre. Its striking aesthetics have become part of a larger cultural phenomenon, influencing a generation of Vietnamese youth including myself. “The Boys” was unlike any album I’d ever seen  — the CD casing wasn’t the typical clear, uniform jewel case normally seen on the shelves at music stores. The most extras I’d ever seen in an album before, in addition to the compact disc itself, was a booklet insert with several lyric pages encased within a square acrylic frame. Instead, this Girls’ Generation album was a pink box reminiscent of an empty cookie tin my grandma used to store her threads and needles. The disc was nestled in a soft foam cutout inside the tin box, and underneath was a thick fairytale-themed photobook filled with high-quality images, a stack of postcard-sized pictures, and a photocard of one of the nine group members inserted randomly. This combination of visually enticing packaging and the thrill of getting an element of surprise, in most cases a randomized photocard, makes buying a K-pop album more than just for the music. </p>
        
          <p> Fast forward to the present day, K-pop continues to rise in popularity worldwide as seen by its growing presence on the music charts. For years now, CDs have been a dying trend within the music industry. The main reason is that streaming allows people to listen to a wider catalog of songs and is cheaper than investing in a physical copy. </p>

                <p class="sidecap"> IFPI's 2023 Top 10 Global Album Sales Chart with nine out of ten spots belonging to K-pop albums</p>
            </div> 


            <p> The global decline in CD sales over the years can be attributed to the dominance of streaming culture. According to <a href="https://www.riaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RIAA-Mid-Year-2023-Revenue-Report.pdf">the Recording Industry Association of America’s 2023 mid-year music revenue report</a>, physical media only represented about 11% of recorded revenue in the United States, while streaming dominated with 84%. However, the phenomenon seems to differ for K-pop albums, where substantial physical sales are on the rise. At the end of 2023, more than <a href="https://circlechart.kr/page_article/view.circle?sgenre=opinion&idx=23345"> 115 million albums </a> were sold in South Korea, a figure that almost doubled from the previous year. In 2023, five out of 10 albums on the <a href="https://www.ifpi.org/seventeens-fml-announced-by-ifpi-as-biggest-selling-global-album-of-the-year/"> International Federation of the Phonographic Industry’s Global Top 10 Album Chart </a> were from K-pop artists, with the first and second spots going to SEVENTEEN and Stray Kids for their respective albums, “FML” and “5-Star”. In IFPI’s 2023 Global Album Sales Chart, only one album in the top 20 wasn’t by a K-pop act, and that was Taylor Swift’s “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” which reportedly sold 2.8 million units globally, ranking sixth overall. </p>
        
     

          <p>The answer for this constant physical media increase, even in a digitally reliant music market? <strong class="standout">A dedicated fanbase.</strong></p>

  		    <p>What K-pop and Taylor Swift’s fandoms have in common is a shared dedication that directly affects their favorite artist’s success. The cult following for both Swift and many K-pop groups, notably boy groups, is reflected in the massive sales figures due to the distribution of different merchandise. Within the K-pop scene, the fierce competition between fandoms of different groups to break records and establish a top presence for their idols on music charts drives them to purchase CDs. Fans often band together to bulk purchase the recordings upon release by hosting organized group orders or by some individuals buying multiple copies to boost sales. While the competitive nature coupled with the loyalty of K-pop audiences might be why fans still purchase CDs in the streaming age, the explanation for their exponential sales is attributed to the 5.5 x 8.5-centimeter credit card-sized photos that come with these CDs, known as <strong class="standout">“photocards.”</strong><strong class="italics"> The catch — you won’t know which photocard you will get when buying a CD. </strong> These small, collectible prints are distributed randomly in the album package, typically featuring a selfie photo of a member of that K-pop group. The excitement of these so-called photocard “pulls” is often referred to as the best part of buying a K-pop album. A survey for this thesis targeting K-pop fans was conducted through Google Forms in a multiple choice and long answer format that received 375 responses. The survey aimed to collect <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11rppobswiOLY3JM2iPgiQHxalk9GkWZXzygI8oj7Ve0/edit?usp=sharing">demographic information</a> of respondents and understand the factors that drive fans to purchase physical albums, particularly focusing on the role of collectibles like photocards. Of the 375 participants, a significant <strong class="standout">91%</strong> indicated that that photocards and other randomized photo inclusions have previously influenced their decision to purchase physical media. This finding suggests that merchandise and collectible items have a strong appeal among K-pop fans. The survey also delved into fans' views on collecting photocards, exploring their personal reasons for engaging in this aspect of fandom culture. Questions include whether fans own any photocards with sentimental value, their thoughts on how photocards contribute to marketing in K-pop and the role of these collectibles in fostering a sense of community with others. </p>

  		    <p> Memorabilia has always played an important role in shaping fandom as it involves the tangible aspect of fan culture. Fans acquire collectibles and merchandise associated with their favorite franchises or people, allowing them to deepen the meaning of their experience. The commodification of the fan experience capitalizes on the emotional connections between fans and their favorite artists or turning cultural phenomena into merchandise. This can include action figures, posters and trading cards to name a few. The practice is integral to participatory culture as fans actively engage with the content they love. Collecting trading cards has been a long-standing hobby that predates the digital era and has roots in sports cards. The Allegheny Card Company's creation, “The Baseball Card Game,” was designed to replicate a baseball game. It is recognized as the first trading card game by the Guinness Book of Records. In John Bloom’s “A House of Cards: Baseball Card Collecting and Popular Culture” (1997), he detailed the hobby of baseball card collecting and its start in the mid-to-late 19th Century. Baseball cards were originally produced as part of giveaways included with products such as tobacco as a way to attract customers. The cards often featured illustrations or photographs of baseball players. Over the decades, various manufacturers produced cards with different designs, formats, and themes. What adds an element of fun is the unpredictability of whose picture you will find. The hobby became more organized in the 20th Century, with the establishment of companies such as <a href="https://www.topps.com/">Topps</a>, which played a significant role in shaping the modern baseball card market. In addition to baseball, Topps expanded into other sports including hockey and basketball, and also ventured into entertainment trading cards. The company’s most notable artist collaboration was with The Beatles during the height of Beatlemania in the 1960s. The band was among the first musicians to capitalize on different forms of <a href="https://nathanjollywrites.wordpress.com/2016/02/10/the-history-of-music-merch/">merchandise</a>, and these cards, featuring photos of the members, were often included as inserts in packages of Topps chewing gum or sold separately in packs.</p>

  		    <p>From a business standpoint, trading cards can foster long-term consumer engagement and loyalty. The concept of randomized trading card packs encourages repeat purchases from fans, and especially collectors, through the pursuit of getting the desired card or completing a card set. The K-pop industry realized the commercial success of trading cards, took this model and began including photocards in CDs in the early 2010s to provide fans with more collectible items of their favorite artists. The history of collecting photocards within fandoms is intricately connected to the evolution of K-pop culture as this practice became an integral part of the fan experience. Although the K-pop fandom is not the first to engage with this practice, they are credited for the widespread popularity of the activity in the modern music landscape. The first album to include a photocard in K-pop history was SM Entertainment’s nine-member girl group, Girls’ Generation, with the album “Oh!” in 2010. The company is known for being a pioneer in K-pop, not only bringing the trading card trend to South Korea’s music industry but also the famed training system that casts and manages idol hopefuls. The <a href="https://www.korea.net/AboutKorea/Culture-and-the-Arts/Hallyu">“Hallyu”</a> wave is a phenomenon denoting the global spread of Korean pop culture, and with K-pop groups gaining an international fanbase rapidly, photocards also became a popular collectible for fans.</p>


      <h1 class="sectionhead">III. The Fascination</h1>

        <section class="bigphoto">
             <img src="img/ten.jpg" alt="">
          </section> 


          <p>Anya Heaton bought three copies of the solo debut by the artist known as TEN. Despite the CD exclusively featuring photocards of TEN, a member of the K-pop boy group NCT, she had hopes of pulling a specific one showing the singer with his pet cat. It wasn’t until her third attempt that Heaton finally got the exact card she wanted. Photocards are randomly included in uniform album packaging so fans won’t know what they will get. If luck is on their side, they might expect to pull a photocard of their favorite group member, also known as one’s “bias.” If not, K-pop fans engage in “bulk-buying,” the activity of purchasing more than one copy of the same product in hopes of getting the desired photocard. This strategy has proven to be successful for K-pop companies to sell more copies and therefore help their artists chart higher, not only on the South Korean charts, but also internationally. Even in albums by soloists, such as TEN, multiple photocard versions of the singer are included at random draws. Another financial tactic employed by these companies is inherent in K-pop’s production formula. By having multiple members in one group, various versions of the same recording featuring different members on the cover can be created to drive up sales even more. This aspect already provides K-pop groups with a numerical advantage over solo artists such as Taylor Swift when it comes to selling physical copies. However, with some of her more recent releases, such as  “folklore” in 2020 and “Midnights” in 2022, Swift released multiple variants of her vinyl for fans to buy and add to their collection. These vinyl records have different cover art but all contain the same tracks. </p>

          <p>In this digital age, fans no longer find the need to purchase CDs or albums for music consumption. Only <strong class="standout">15%</strong> of respondents in the K-pop fan survey reported actively listening to the compact disc included with every K-pop purchase. Although the music can now be accessed digitally, fans share the sentiment that digital applications, despite their convenience, fail to provide the same satisfaction as owning a physical product. Instead, fans view CDs, and their content, as collectible items worth displaying for their striking visual appeal. With aesthetics playing a central role in merchandising, K-pop groups often craft their visual identities through unique album packaging with specific concepts or themes. Each CD release, dubbed a “comeback,” will introduce a new theme, leading to different package designs to reflect or enhance that concept. Girl group Red Velvet’s release, “The ReVe Festival 2022 – Birthday,” featured a version called “Cake” where the design is a cylinder-shaped package resembling a birthday cake. The “Cake” version is available in five different colors, each representing a member of the group. </p>

              <div class="sidepic right">
              <img src="img/rvcake2.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="sidecap"> Red Velvet's album "The Reve Festival 2022 : BIRTHDAY [CAKE ver.]" comes in five unique versions, one for each member</p>
              </div>  


          <p> Standard K-pop albums are designed to accommodate not only the CD and photocards, but also other inclusions such as posters, stickers and photobooks. In recent years, K-pop companies started releasing more cost-effective versions as another part of their unique marketing strategy. The companies began selling packages without CDs, instead including a digital download card to reflect the shift in music consumption. The music is accessed by scanning a QR code and a unique serial number placed inside the package. Once the QR code is scanned, fans can access a variety of digital content — music, exclusive photos and even videos from the artist. Although these CD packages differ in inclusions, the one common denominator and driving force behind sales is the photocard. When fans buy multiple copies of the same album, they expect the photocard inclusions to be different but are still left with excess copies of the same album photobooks that come in identical outer packaging. Additionally, gaining entrance to “fansigns,” an event where fans can meet their idols and have their CDs signed, is usually based on a lottery system with one physical purchase equaling one entry. Entertainment companies have gradually taken steps to release more eco-friendly packaging to address concerns about waste from fans’ buying activities. The head leader of YG’s production and marketing group, <a href="https://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=202205061602310410">Yi Bo-young</a> said the entertainment company started using environmentally friendly paper certified by the <a href="https://www.kr.fsc.org/en">Forest Stewardship Council</a> that produces less carbon. "We also switched to soy ink and water-based coating … we expect that the albums will be more biodegradable," Yi said. While K-pop fandoms are often blamed for their contribution to wasteful practices, companies should also be held accountable for the system they created that encourages these fans to buy mass amounts of products. “Before collecting became popular, companies would only release a few versions of each album with one or two photocards per member but in the last couple of years, some albums have 20 plus versions because they know people will buy them to collect the photocards,” said Canadian K-pop fan Ayva Ekins in the collectors’ survey response. Ekins believes this change caused even more waste because people will end up throwing out the extra albums due to a lack of storage space, or simply because they only bought the album for the photocards.</p>

          <p> The appeal of photocards extends beyond the marketing for albums but its integration into other merchandise like clothing and accessories creates a compelling incentive for fans to make a purchase. These photocards often feature unique images, different from those in albums, providing fans with a reason to seek out and collect them. The allure of owning a limited-edition photocard can be as strong as the desire for the product itself. When K-pop idols collaborate with brands whether it's chain restaurants like Wanna One partnering with Lotteria in 2018 or beauty brands such as HERA choosing BLACKPINK’s Jennie as their ambassador in 2019, their campaigns often feature exclusive photocards as part of the promotional bundle, adding a significant draw for fans. <a href="https://www.dispatch.co.kr/2279794">Reports</a> from early 2024 indicate that thirteen centers affiliated with the Seoul Southern Blood Center initiated a campaign offering SEVENTEEN photocards to individuals who donated blood. The response was overwhelmingly positive, particularly among teenagers and those in their twenties, leading to an 80.6% increase in new blood donors compared to the same period the previous year. The fact that a celebrity endorsement can dramatically influence public health efforts further highlights the unique purchashing power of K-pop and its fandoms.</p>

        <h1 class="sectionhead"> IV. The Selfhood</h1>


            <p>Collecting is closely tied to the construction and expression of personal identity. The items collected represent the fan’s sense of self and are often used to communicate aspects of their identity with fellow fans. According to Lincoln Geraghty in “Cult Collectors: Nostalgia, Fandom and Collecting Popular Culture” (2014), the collection is given significance by its collector. It is the investment of personal memories in building the collection that imbues the objects with meaning. Cultural sociologist Susan Pearce identified three primary modes of collecting: <strong class="standout">fetishistic, souvenir, and systematic.</strong></p>

            <p>In <strong class="standout">fetishistic</strong> collecting, collectors have a strong desire to collect for the sake of possession and accumulate as many objects as they can. Some K-pop photocard collectors often identify as “completionists,” characterized by the need to possess all the photocards in their defined collection. In the photocard collecting community, dedicated fans create “photocard templates” to keep track of the cards that come with each group’s respective release and share them with other fans for communal use.</p>

              <div class="sidepic right">
              <img src="img/template2.jpg" alt="">
              <p class="sidecap"> Fanmade photocard template for all nine members of girl group TWICE in their album "With You-th" (by @brtxxe_trade) </p>
              </div>  


            <p>These templates are typically categorized and sorted according to a particular group member or CD version, both are popular collections that fans take up. Templates are meant to be guides for fans, but some see them as goals and try to attain as many from their chosen template as possible.</p>

            <p> Quetzaly Sanchez describes herself as a completionist with her K-pop photocard collection. She attributes her collecting behavior to the industry's marketing tactics that generate excessive photocard rollouts. “Whenever a new album drops there are always preorder photocard benefits and fansign photocards which increase the groups’ album sale count and they make collectors like myself feel like I have to have that card or my collection will never be complete,” Sanchez said. “I think that if it weren’t for these extra exclusive photocards with short buying periods then a lot of groups wouldn’t sell as many albums as they do.” </p>
                <div class="sidepic left popup">
                <img src="img/mingi.jpg" alt="">

                </div>

            <p>Preorder photocard benefits (POBs) were popularized during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic as a strategy for K-pop companies to combat the sudden loss of revenue, mainly from the pause in live touring due to lockdown restrictions. The companies distribute their products to different online retailers and each store offers fans a different benefit, often a unique photocard variant, as an incentive for buying from the designated site. Since the POBs differ at each store, fans purchase the same album multiple times on different websites to collect exclusive benefits. However, this business strategy received public criticism suggesting that entertainment companies exploited fans’ loyalty and violated consumer protection laws. Concerns about these marketing tactics reached the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), leading to a formal investigation in mid-2023 into major K-pop entertainment companies like HYBE, SM, and YG. The KFTC aimed to determine whether these companies were unfairly inflating album sales by encouraging excessive photocard collection, not only through preorder benefits and also the regular album inclusions.
</p>

            <p> <strong class="standout">Souvenir</strong> collecting focuses on objects that serve as mementos of personal experiences, places visited, or events attended. The value lies in the memories and associations attached to the items. At concerts and fan meeting events, K-pop groups often have booths where attendees can redeem a venue-specific photocard with their valid concert ticket. The photocard is distributed through a draw where fans get a random card and are encouraged to trade with others at the venue. On the back of these cards, the name and date of the event are printed so fans can preserve memories through this tangible item. K-pop fan Melanie Nava, who has been collecting since the COVID-19 pandemic began, considers photocards she gets at concerts the more sentimental items in her collection. “I have my seven ENHYPEN fanzone photocards that were exclusive to their L.A. concert that I got all signed during their send-off event,” she said in an interview. Since the photocards are concert-exclusive items and were also signed by the members when Nava met them, she keeps them in a separate protective frame for display. With most concert tickets now being distributed digitally, the implementation of event-specific photocards by K-pop companies has become a new and treasured substitute for fans to keep as tangible memories of their experiences. </p>

            <p> Lastly, <strong class="standout">systematic</strong> collecting follows a methodical and organized approach, with an emphasis on categorization and creating a comprehensive collection within a specific framework. Some fans craft collections that showcase their unique fan identity. Shin Yu collects photocards of idols wearing glasses because she feels a personal connection to the theme. “I love this specific collection of mine because I’m able to relate in a way because I also have prescription glasses,” she said in her collectors’ survey response. Yu also possesses a collection of K-pop photocards, all of which are in her favorite color, pink.</p>

                </div> 

            <p> Collector Erika Troconis from Florida has a unique collection of food-and-drink-themed photocards from different idols of different groups. Although she has been a K-pop fan since 2008, Troconis didn’t start collecting photocards until 2019 when she had disposable income from her job to fund this expensive hobby. “Now I collect several groups at different levels — some full group collections, some with selected members and some I just collect the albums instead of the photocard inclusions,” she said. In March of 2023, Troconis took up a collection focusing on photocards with K-pop idols holding different food and drink items. “I think this theme is fun and it gives me a fun collection to work on instead of other collections I have that feel more like a chore because of how extensive they are.”</p>

      <p>Products such as binders and photocard holders are also popular among fans to store their collections or display certain photocards. In the K-pop community, fans like to associate idols with certain animals based on factors such as their personalities, facial features and sometimes their stage names or personas. Member Hoshi of SEVENTEEN goes by a stage name that means “tiger’s gaze,” describing his sharp stare while performing on stage. Fans of the idol often seek out tiger-themed photocard holders or decorate their binders to reflect his persona. For her food and drink photocards collection, Troconis buys food-themed fanmade holders to display her photocards.</p>

      <p>These three modes identified by Pearce offer different lenses that explain how K-pop fans engage with collecting photocards, and the three methods can intersect as these elements contribute to the understanding of the fandom practice.</p>

  		<p>At its core, collecting is considered a social activity. The collectible nature fosters a sense of community among fans who share a common interest in obtaining and trading photocards. Traditionally, sites such as eBay are popular among a previous generation of collectors to buy and sell items, but forums to discuss trading are limited. However, the new generation of collectors has found different ways to centralize their collecting activities and one of the most popular is through Instagram’s tag system. Through tags such as “#wtt” and “#wts,” meaning “want to trade” and “want to sell,” fans can customize what they post to reach the targeted audience. If a BLACKPINK fan wants to post and sell the group’s photocards, they can customize the tags to be “#wtsblackpink” or “#blackpinksale.” Posts appearing under these tags can also help buyers in browsing through a variety of photocards, with the hope of finding the particular ones they desire. Sellers can be from the area, within the country and even across the globe, which expands the market widely. The digital age has moved trading activities online, but in-person events still occur as they offer fans the chance to meet their local fan communities. Noor Akhter started hosting in-person trading events in February of 2023 in the Orange County area and had been a part of the K-pop trading community online for at least two years prior. “My friends and I had actually met each other through the community online and one of the first times we’d all hung out in person was through an in-person trading event,” Akhter shared in an interview. The meeting gave Akhter and her friends the idea to plan one of their own events as a way to meet and trade photocards with fans in the area. She believes she has fostered a greater sense of her local K-pop fan community by participating and hosting in-person trading events. At these events, fans can also save the hassle of packing and shipping photocards, which can be costly. Products such as Toploaders to protect the photocards from bending, envelopes to hold the item and postage are extra costs that fans have to assume when trading photocards online.</p>

       <p> Not only trading but buying CDs can surprisingly be a social activity for fans. L.A.-based fan Jessica Cross often gathers a group of friends to visit K-pop stores to buy CDs and unbox them together. “I love opening albums with friends because of the thrill in discovering which photocard we pulled, and we can also trade if we pull each other’s biases,” she said in an interview during a photocard trading event at hello82, a K-pop fan space located in Los Angeles. Photocards have also become an unexpected accessory for fans as they often display their cards on carriers such as tote bags and purses. </p>

      <p>“It’s such a conversation starter because fans will spot a photocard on someone’s bag and be like, ‘Hey! I stan that group’ or ‘That’s my bias too!’ ’” Cross shared that one night when she was out, a fellow fan came up to her to gift a photocard of Joshua from SEVENTEEN after seeing one of him attached to her handbag. Although the two didn’t speak the same language because Cross was in a foreign country, she was touched by the non-verbal interaction. More than just a conversation starter with strangers, photocards are a way for groups of K-pop friends to uniquely capture memories together. As an alternative to selfies, fans take pictures of their photocards, often of each person’s respective bias, when gathering together. Even if their faces might not be present in the picture, fans feel adequately represented through these photocards of their favorite idols instead. This social element enhances the overall fandom experience because fans create memories by bonding over their excitement and love for shared interests.</p>

    <h1 class="sectionhead">VI. The Impact </h1>

  		<p>As a K-pop fan for over a decade, I feel most connected to my identity as a photocard collector. Through this hobby, I built the strongest connections with fellow fans and was able to make sense of my own fandom experience. Over the years, I've experienced the rush of opening albums to find randomized inclusions, the satisfaction of completing a photocard set and the joy of meeting collectors who share my passion. My collection has grown and so has my appreciation for the creativity, effort, and dedication that go into K-pop photocard collecting. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was a pivotal moment in my collecting journey, largely because it became the primary way to pass the time while quarantined at home. During those long months of isolation, my collection of SEVENTEEN photocards provided not only a distraction but offered a much-needed routine as I found comfort in collecting, organizing and trading them with fans online as we adapted to the new reality. It’s part amazing and part fascinating how a simple piece of paper can become a source of meaning, nostalgia, and community for fans. In the realm of K-pop, these photocards are more than just collectible items—they represent a tangible link to the fans’ favorite idols, capture a moment in time or an expression that resonates deeply.</p>
